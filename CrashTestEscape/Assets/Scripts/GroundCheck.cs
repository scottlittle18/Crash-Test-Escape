/// Used to detect if the attached character is on the ground

/// Implamentation Steps:
///     - Create an Empty Child GameObject for the GameObject that will be using this
///     - (OPTIONAL) Name the Empty Child GameObject that was created in the previous step "GroundCheck"
///     - Add a BoxCollider2D component to the Empty Child Object created in the first step
///     - Set the new BoxCollider2D component's IsTrigger property to true in-editor
///     - Edit the BoxCollider2D so that it is situated at the bottom of the parent Gameobject and is the correct size
///     - **IMPORTANT NOTE** - Ensure that the BoxCollider2D doesn't stop short of the parent GameObject's non-trigger collider!
///     - Create a new tag specifically named "Ground"
///     - Create a new layer specifically named "Ground"
///     - Test to see if it works
///     - Debug if it doesn't; Otherwise, you're done! ☻
